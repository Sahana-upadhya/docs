I did some research, read a bunch of papers, published a few myself. My groundbreaking work involved (pick one):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item making some models and making some graphs,
	\item proving the universe is a simulation
\end{enumerate}
and now I have a job.  I've assembled this document in the last couple of months so you will let me leave.  Thanks!
